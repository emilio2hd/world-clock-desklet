## Development

Before starting developing, make sure to run `make dev-prepare` to install libs that are not required, but
improves the development experience, like [ESlint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
If you're using vscode, the tools will be enabled as soon as the recommended extesion are installed.  
To check for any lint or code style issue, run `make inspect`.
Note: `dev-prepare` will create a symbolic link to desklet folder. The desklet manager can't delete it normally.
Use `make uninstall` or delete the symbolic link, to uninstall the desklet.

## Translations

Run `make generate-pot` to generate the `po/worldclock@emilio2hd`. Make sure to remove `node_module` before running it.

Use [poedit](https://poedit.net/) and create a new `po` file based on the file generated by the `make` command.

Run `make install-po` to install the translation files.
